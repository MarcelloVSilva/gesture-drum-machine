# Gesture Drum Machine With TensorFlow.js

I'm trying to create a drum machine, based on course JavaScript30, integrate with gestures recognized by TensorFlow.js

I'm new on Machine Learning, i'm new on gesture recognition.

This study/work/hobbie its inspired by Charlie Gerard and her article [Machine Learning For Front-End Developers With Tensorflow.js](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/09/machine-learning-front-end-developers-tensorflowjs/)
